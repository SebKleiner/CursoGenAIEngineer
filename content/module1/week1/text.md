To make a decision, let's consider several factors:

1. **Purpose and Goals**:
   - **Spanish**: Widely spoken in the Americas and Spain, useful for travel, business, and cultural connections in many countries.
   - **French**: An official language in many international organizations, useful in parts of Europe, Africa, and Canada.
   - **Mandarin**: The most spoken language in the world, important for business and travel in China and other Chinese-speaking regions.

2. **Difficulty Level**:
   - **Spanish**: Generally considered easier for English speakers due to similar grammar and vocabulary.
   - **French**: Moderate difficulty, with some complex grammar and pronunciation.
   - **Mandarin**: Considered more challenging due to tones and characters.

3. **Personal Interest**:
   - Consider which culture or region you are most interested in or have connections to.

4. **Practicality**:
   - Think about where you live or plan to travel, and which language might be most useful in your personal or professional life.

5. **Resources**:
   - Check the availability of learning resources, such as classes, apps, or language partners, for each language.

Final Decision:
- If you want a language that is widely spoken and relatively easy to learn, choose **Spanish**.
- If you are interested in international organizations or specific regions like parts of Africa or Canada, choose **French**.
- If you are interested in business opportunities or travel in China, choose **Mandarin**.

Final answer: Choose based on your goals and interests, but for a balance of ease and utility, **Spanish** is a strong choice.
